# CoqApp

A formal verification project written in Coq, the interactive theorem prover.

## Overview

This project demonstrates formal mathematical proofs and program verification using the Coq proof assistant. Coq allows us to express mathematical assertions, mechanically check proofs of these assertions, and extract certified programs from constructive proofs.

## Prerequisites

### Required Software

- **Coq**: Version 8.15 or later
  - Download from [https://coq.inria.fr/](https://coq.inria.fr/)
  - Or install via package manager:
    ```bash
    # On Ubuntu/Debian
    sudo apt-get install coq

    # On macOS with Homebrew
    brew install coq

    # On Windows
    # Download and install from the official website
    ```

- **CoqIDE** (recommended) or your preferred Coq development environment:
  - **VSCode** with the Coq extension
  - **Emacs** with Proof General
  - **Vim** with Coqtail

### Optional Tools

- **Make**: For building the project
- **Dune**: For more complex build configurations
- **CoqDoc**: For generating documentation (usually included with Coq)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd CoqApp
   ```

2. Ensure Coq is properly installed:
   ```bash
   coqc --version
   ```

3. If using a Makefile (when available):
   ```bash
   make
   ```

```

## Usage

### Running Individual Files

To check and compile a single Coq file:

```bash
coqc filename.v
```

### Interactive Development

1. **Using CoqIDE**:
   - Open CoqIDE
   - Load your `.v` files
   - Step through proofs interactively

2. **Using VSCode**:
   - Install the Coq extension
   - Open `.v` files and use Ctrl+Alt+N/P to navigate proofs

3. **Using Emacs with Proof General**:
   - Open `.v` files in Emacs
   - Use C-c C-n/C-c C-u to step through proofs

### Building the Project

If a Makefile is present:

```bash
make                    # Build all files
make clean             # Clean compiled files
make documentation     # Generate documentation
```

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **Inductive Data Types**: Definition of custom data structures
- **Recursive Functions**: Properly terminating recursive definitions
- **Proof Tactics**: Various strategies for constructing proofs
- **Dependent Types**: Types that depend on values
- **Program Extraction**: Converting proofs to executable code

## Example Usage

Here's a simple example of what you might find in this project:

```coq
(* Define natural numbers inductively *)
Inductive nat : Type :=
| O : nat
| S : nat -> nat.

(* Define addition *)
Fixpoint add (n m : nat) : nat :=
  match n with
  | O => m
  | S n' => S (add n' m)
  end.

(* Prove that addition is commutative *)
Theorem add_comm : forall n m : nat, add n m = add m n.
Proof.
  (* Proof by induction... *)
Admitted.
```

## Documentation

- API documentation can be generated using CoqDoc:
  ```bash
  coqdoc --html --utf8 -d docs/ src/*.v
  ```

- Open `docs/index.html` in your browser to view the generated documentation

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-proof`)
3. Make your changes and ensure all proofs compile
4. Test your proofs thoroughly
5. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add amazing proof'`)
6. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-proof`)
7. Create a Pull Request

### Code Style Guidelines

- Use descriptive names for definitions and theorems
- Include comments explaining the intuition behind complex proofs
- Break large proofs into smaller lemmas
- Follow consistent indentation and formatting

## Testing

Run all proofs to ensure they compile:

```bash
# If using Make
make test

# Or manually check all files
find . -name "*.v" -exec coqc {} \;
```

## Common Issues

### Compilation Errors

- **Universe inconsistency**: Check for circular dependencies in type definitions
- **Termination checking**: Ensure recursive functions have proper termination arguments
- **Tactic failures**: Verify that proof goals match your expectations

### Performance Issues

- Large proof terms can slow compilation
- Consider using `Opaque` declarations for performance-critical definitions
- Use `Qed` instead of `Defined` when the proof term isn't needed
